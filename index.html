Endorphin is a cross platform web browser built using Qt and WebKit.
<p>
It is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/Arora/arora">Arora browser</a>.
Arora was created by Benjamin C. Meyer, Endorphin was created by Aaron Dewes.
</p>
<p>
The goal of Endorphin is to create a lightwight, fast and simple browser, that has many features and is compatible with most websites.
Endorphin is still in development, so no releases are available now, but the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/AaronDewes/endorphin-browser">GitHub</a>.
